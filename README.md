# foreman_proxy_content

This module is designed to configure a Foreman proxy server for Katello content features. In practice this means installing Pulp 3 using [theforeman-pulpcore](https://github.com/theforeman/puppet-pulpcore) and configuring it. It can also set up a reverse proxy for RHSM (Red Hat Subscription Manager).

See the CONTRIBUTING guide for steps on how to make a change and get it accepted upstream.
